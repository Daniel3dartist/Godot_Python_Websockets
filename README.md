# Godot Python Websockets
This project is a demo of how to use websockets to communicate between gdscript and python. In the example we use GPT-2 to generate responses based on the input received by the application.


NOTE: We are in the development stage and still need to implement some features such as user voice recognition. Feel free to follow the project and suggest improvements.
